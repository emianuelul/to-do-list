# to-do-list

App I made for The Odin Project. Style is basic because that wasn't the purpose. Might return to it later to add other stuff.

## How To Use

- Create a new project by clicking on the plus on the left and then inputting a name and an emoji for the project.
- Create new To-Do's by clicking on the plus on the right, input a prompt, a due date and optionally a description
- You can 'Favorite' a To-Do to highlight it and make it appear in a dedicated 'Favorites' tab
- You can delete both To-Do's AND projects/categories by clicking on the trash can button, the item that will get deleted will also get highlighted
- You can edit project names, To-Do prompts and To-Do descriptions by double clicking on them and then typing the new name
